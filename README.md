# Phonebook
Simple phonebook in php

Note: in the current version, is necessary that the user runs Open Phone Book at the start, so the program can load the data from the file. Is also necessary that the user runs Save Phone Book at the end (in case they modify something). 

 Ideas I intend to implement: 
 1 . Modify this so the program auto runs openPhoneBook everytime it starts so the user dont have to do it by themselves
 2 . Modify this so the program auto runs savePhoneBooks so the user dont have to do it by themselves
